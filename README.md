# NREL-5MW-coordinates
Accurate coordinates for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) 5 megawatt (MW) wind turbine are critical for wind energy research and analysis. The NREL 5MW is a widely used model for this purpose. Additionally, precise x-y coordinates for the airfoil shape data from TU Delft are also important.
